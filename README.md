# INVENTORY-MANAGENT-SYSTEM
This is my new project inventory management system. This is dynamic program and able to handle error in function. Here the program asks for the type of mode to function ( customer/ Manager) CUSTOMER MODE: if customer asks for the product id, quantity of item to purchase also displays the total amount of the billing, it can detect whether the given product id is valid are not and accordingly act to it. Even when the customer wants to add more items it prompts and ask whether want to continue or not, if no then it breaks and ends the program. MANAGER MODE: In this mode the the own who own the inventory a can see the number of items, rate and can identify the whether it is in stock or out of stock. also he can check multiple items. And ends with message.
